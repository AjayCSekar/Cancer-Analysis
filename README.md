# Cancer-Analysis
To analyse whether the patient has breast cancer or not with medical data report.

# Steps in the project:
- First we import the dataset and understand the data and features.

- We perform EDA on the data by removing unwanted columns.

- We create a list of dependant and independant features.

- We split the data into 80% training data and 20% testing data.

- We will create a classifier model, in our case Random Forest performed better than other classification models.

- Train the Random Forest model with training data, tune the hyper parameters to get the best of the model.

- Evaluate the model on the test data.

- Calculate the model performance, in our case the model performed well with 96% Accuracy and with good precision and 
   recallfor the classes.
